        "# Introduction\n",
        "Sleep apnea in children poses a significant health concern, affecting approximately one to five percent of children in the United States. Unlike adult sleep apnea, pediatric sleep apnea presents distinct clinical causes and characteristics, demanding specialized attention. However, research dedicated to pediatric sleep apnea detection has been comparatively limited, especially concerning at-home testing tools and algorithmic approaches for automatic detection. Addressing this gap is crucial due to the potential adverse effects of untreated pediatric sleep apnea on both physical and mental health.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polysomnography, the gold standard for diagnosing sleep-related breathing disorders, including apnea and hypopnea, presents numerous challenges, such as complexity, cost, and the need for clinical involvement. Consequently, there is a growing interest in developing accessible and effective diagnostic methods, particularly for pediatric populations, to mitigate the limitations of traditional polysomnography.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have spurred research into machine learning-based approaches for diagnosing sleep apnea without relying on polysomnography. While some studies have shown promising results in adults, research focusing on pediatric populations remains scarce. This scarcity underscores the importance of the present study, which introduces a machine learning-based model specifically tailored for detecting apnea events in children using commonly collected sleep signals.\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper proposed a machine learning-based model for detecting obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) in pediatric patients using commonly collected sleep signals. It aimed to address the gap in pediatric sleep apnea detection by presenting a method that could achieve adult-level performance in detecting OSAHS patterns in children. It also introduced a customized transformer-based architecture for detecting OSAHS, which showed superior performance compared to existing methods. It utilized a novel data representation technique to handle polysomnography modalities, enabling the model to effectively process signals from different sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "The study extensively explored the role of different combinations of common modalities and demonstrated that using only two easier-to-collect signals (ECG and SpO2) could achieve close to maximum performance. The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art methods across two public datasets, as determined by the F1-score and AUROC measures. Additionally, using only ECG and SpO2 signals, which are easier to collect at home, the method achieved very competitive results, addressing concerns about collecting various sleep signals from children outside the clinic. The paper contributes significantly to the research regime by addressing the gap in pediatric sleep apnea detection, which has been understudied compared to adult sleep apnea, introducing a novel machine learning-based approach specifically tailored for pediatric OSAHS detection, which can potentially improve the accessibility of pediatric sleep apnea testing and treatment interventions, and demonstrating the feasibility of achieving adult-level performance in detecting OSAHS in children, thereby advancing the field towards more accessible and timely diagnosis and treatment of pediatric sleep disorders.\n"
